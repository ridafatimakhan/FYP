# Final Year Project
 Massive Online Course System
 MOOC System for Seerat-un-Nabi ﷺ is an extension of the software – Muallim’s
Learning and Testing System. It is a web-based application facilitating the distant
learners of the biography (Seerat-Un-Nabi) of the last messenger of Allah, Muhammad
(PBUH)”. MOOC system operating already in the market including Coursera, EdX was
not providing some of the features in every course like interactive learning was only
available in some courses but in our system, we made it possible to all the courses. The
software facilitates the learners in a systematic way using the Computer Based Learning
(Interactive learning) and tests their understanding through its Computer Based Testing
service. The software offers self-paced, affordable quality education supported by
modern technological tools to the learners beyond the geographical boundaries.
